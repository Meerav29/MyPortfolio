Tracking near-Earth objects used to require specialized software. With modern APIs the barrier to entry is much lower. For a weekend hack I pulled orbital data from NASA and rendered it in a small dashboard.

The core of the pipeline was a simple Pandas script that shaped JSON into something chartable.

```python
import pandas as pd
import requests

resp = requests.get("https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/neo/3542519?api_key=DEMO_KEY")
data = pd.json_normalize(resp.json()["close_approach_data"])
print(data.head())
```

The prototype ran entirely on the client using WebGL for the 3D plot. Although the model lacked precision, it demonstrated how approachable space data has become for hobbyists.
