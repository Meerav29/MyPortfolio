Every once in a while, I get curious about whether these flashy “AI code-gen platforms” are actually useful or just another way to waste an afternoon. So, in the spirit of scientific inquiry (and also because I had other work to procrastinate), I decided to **throw three of them into the ring**:  

- **Base44**  
- **Bolt.new**  
- **Lovable.dev**  

The idea was simple: same general prompts, same expectations, let’s see what they do.  

Spoiler: I got three very different flavors of frustration.

## Base44 — The One-Shot Wonder (That You Can’t Actually Use)

Base44 came out swinging. It basically produced the **best version of my project in one shot**. Okay, maybe not one — but by prompt number four, I had something shockingly close to perfect.  

Naturally, I started to get excited. *“Wow, maybe this thing is actually going to replace me. Maybe I’ll have to pivot to basket weaving or goat farming after all.”*  

And then reality set in.  

You can’t export the code. At all.  
Not to GitHub. Not to a zip file. Not even a sad little `.txt` dump.  

It’s like ordering the best burger of your life and being told you can only eat it in the restaurant — and also they’re closing in 10 minutes.  

**Verdict:** Technically brilliant, practically useless.

## Bolt.new — Death by Error Messages

Next up was Bolt.new. I went in optimistic — the branding is slick, the pitch sounds good. And then… nothing.  

I never even got a basic front end to run. The platform stumbled on trivial builds, tossed out vague error messages, and offered no way to actually fix them. Think of it as being given a locked car with no keys — and when you ask for help, they say, “Have you tried turning the ignition?”  

So yeah, no product, no learning, just vibes.  

**Verdict:** Bolt didn’t bolt. It limped off the track before the race began.

## Lovable.dev — The Ugly Duckling with GitHub Integration

Lovable’s first impression? Let’s just say it lived up to its name *ironically*.  

The app it generated was a weird mess:  
- Light mode only.  
- Random yellow borders like someone spilled mustard in the CSS.  
- Buttons that were literally invisible unless you hovered on them (white text on a white button, chef’s kiss).  

So, no — not “lovable.” At least not initially.  

But here’s where it pulled ahead: **GitHub integration**. I could push the repo out, clone it locally, and actually start fixing things. Which I did — with a *lot* of Codex babysitting. Eventually, I wrangled it into something that actually deployed and worked.  

And that felt good. It wasn’t clean, it wasn’t elegant, but it was mine.  

**Verdict:** Starts like a bad blind date, ends like a decent friendship.

## Takeaways

Here’s how I’d sum it up:  

- **Base44**: Made me the best product but locked me in like an overprotective parent.  
- **Bolt.new**: Promised fireworks, gave me damp matches.  
- **Lovable.dev**: Served me chaos, but at least let me carry the mess home and make it better.  

If you’re serious about building, my advice is this: **pick the tool that gives you freedom, not the one that gives you perfection.** Because “perfect” doesn’t mean much if you can’t actually take it with you.

*Sidequest complete. The next one might involve combining the outputs of all three tools into one Franken-app. Worst case, I learn what happens when you let three different AIs argue inside the same repo.*
