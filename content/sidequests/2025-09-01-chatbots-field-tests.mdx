Chatbots are often evaluated in sterile lab settings, yet their true value emerges when they are pushed into messy, real-world scenarios. In classrooms, for example, students phrase questions with slang and half-finished thoughts. These nuances expose edge cases that never appear in benchmark suites.

Field testing reveals how models cope with ambiguity. It also highlights the importance of clear error messaging. Users rarely read documentation; instead, they poke and prod until something breaks.

```python
from typing import Iterable

def count_questions(messages: Iterable[str]) -> int:
    return sum(m.endswith("?") for m in messages)
```

The above snippet is a toy example used during one pilot. By counting question marks we approximated curiosity over a semester. Surprisingly, question frequency correlated with grades, suggesting that conversational agents can encourage inquiry when deployed thoughtfully.
