After that accident, I started exploring the trails around State College and while I initially wanted to make a trail map - I wanted to experiment with Leaflet.js before I did and that's how I made this project. 

Map Dash began as a weekend experiment and the result is a single-page application that layers weather, air quality, satellite, and storm intelligence on top of an interactive Leaflet map. 

### Designing the Interface
I wanted the interface to feel like a mini control room. Tailwind’s utility classes made it easy to compose a dark-themed layout with a left-hand dashboard selector, geolocation and fullscreen shortcuts, and a responsive map viewport that expands on larger screens. Custom CSS polishes the experience with a pulsing “you are here” marker, harmonized Leaflet controls, and a fullscreen mode that hides surrounding chrome when you need an immersive view. 

### Bringing the Dashboards to Life
Each dashboard activation leans on Leaflet events and overlays to give immediate feedback. Clicking a card runs the corresponding activate* function, updates the info panel docked to the map, and, when appropriate, paints markers or tile layers directly on the map canvas.

1. Air Quality: Open-Meteo’s air-quality API feeds hourly AQI, PM2.5, and PM10 data; a color-coded circle marker highlights the reading right on the map, so air conditions are instantly visible.

2. Storm Tracker: The National Weather Service GeoJSON feed is parsed into Leaflet layers, and a small Haversine helper estimates how close the nearest alert sits relative to the map center, translating distances into “no threat,” “low threat,” or “high alert” messaging.

3. Satellite Explorer: A custom Leaflet control lets you toggle between Esri, USGS, and Sentinel-2 imagery. Layer changes refresh the info panel so you always know which provider you’re viewing.

### Work in Progress
There's a few features I want to add and I'm still figuring out:
1. Real-Time Weather: A call to Open-Meteo retrieves the latest temperature and wind readings for the current map center, while an optional OpenWeatherMap cloud layer adds visual context for atmospheric coverage.
2. Precipitation Map: If you drop in an OpenWeatherMap key, the app overlays both cloud and precipitation tiles, giving a quick glance at active systems sweeping the area.
