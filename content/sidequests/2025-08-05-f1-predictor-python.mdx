Formula 1 generates mountains of telemetry. During one particularly rainy weekend I wondered whether simple models could anticipate podium placements using only lap-time deltas.

The experiment was tongue-in-cheek but instructive. After scraping race data I fed it into a scikit-learn pipeline. The results were noisy yet hinted at patterns.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

The takeaway? Even playful models reveal the influence of pit strategy and tire choices. While I wouldn't bet the house on this predictor, it sparked useful conversations with friends who follow the sport religiously.
